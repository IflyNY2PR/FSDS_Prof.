title: "Presenting Data"
week: 10

## Overview

This week is focussed on formalising our understanding of how to tune `matplotlib` plots to 'publication quality' by tweaking fine-grained elements. So this week we face off with the monster that most Python visualisation libraries ultimately depend on: `matplotlib`. 

As a tool it is both incredibly powerful and intensely *counter*-intuitive if you are used to R's `ggplot`. We will also be looking more widely to the future of quantitative methods, the potential of a *geographic* data science, and the ways in which we can move between spatial and non-spatial paradigms of analysis within the same piece of work.

## Learning Outcomes

1. You have broadened your thinking about the purpose of data visualisation.
2. You are working intensively on the [group project](../assessments/group.qmd).

## Other Preparation

### Readings

Come to class prepared to discuss the following readings:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false

readings = {
  'Xie:2024b': ['https://www.divingintodata.com/p/how-to-better-communicate-as-a-data-scientist-6fc5428d3143', False],
}

print("| Citation | Article    | ChatGPT Summary |", end="\n")
print("| :------- | :--------- | :-------------- |", end="\n")

for k,v in readings.items():
  chapter = f'{v[2]} ' if len(v)==3 else ''
  summary = "[Summary](../readings/" + k.replace(':','-') + ".qmd)" if v[1] else "N/A"
  print(f"| @{k} {chapter}| [URL]({v[0]}) | {summary} |", end="\n")

```

### Additional Resources

You might want to look at the following reports / profiles with a view to thinking about employability and how the skills acquired in this module can be applied beyond the end of your MSc:

- Geospatial Skills Report <[URL](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/demand-for-geospatial-skills-report-for-the-geospatial-commission)>
- AAG Profile of Nicolas Saravia <[URL](https://www.aag.org/profile/nicolas-saravia/)>

## Connections

While I expect most of you will be focussed on assessments, you should *seriously* consider returning to the three readings assigned over Reading Week as they will help you to *reflect* on what you've learned this term in this module and across the programme as a whole. The other three might be useful in terms of looking at the direction of the field, the opportunities in industry, and the kinds of work that people with (sptial) data science skills can do.

## Practical

The practical will lead you through the fine-tuning of data visualisations in Matplotlib/Seaborn. In many ways, this should be seen as largely a recap of material encountered in previous sessions. However, you should see this as an important step in the production of outputs and analyses needed for the final project. That said, you would be better off spending time on the *substance* of the report first and only turning to the fine-tuning of the visualisations if time permits.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Automating the production of map outputs in Python to create an 'atlas'.

:::

To access the practical:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false

prac = "Practical-10-Presenting_Data"

print("1. [Preview]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".html)")
print("2. [Download]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".ipynb)")

```
